## Microservices with Node JS and React

These are the files from Stephen Grider's excellent Udemy course. I am running these NodeJS and React files on a Ubuntu 20.04 VM in WSL2.

NPM Packages: Express, Axios, CORS, Nodemon

You will need to install Postman to test the POST and COMMENTS services.

You will also need create-react-app for the CLIENT application.

The purpose of this repo is to store the relevent files and instructions on how to use them, following the examples in the course.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
