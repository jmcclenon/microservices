## Microservices with Node JS and React

These are the files from Stephen Grider's Udemy course. I al running these file on a Ubuntu 20.04 VM in WSL2.

You will need to install Postman to test the POST and COMMENTS services.

You will also need create-react-app for the CLIENT application.

The purpose of this repo is to store the relevent files and instructions on how to use them, following the examples in the course.
